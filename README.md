            - Clicking a button redirects the user to a window displaying an interactive candlestick plot of stock price versus date.The window also shows the current stock price and provides key company details, including its sector and industry.

            - User has to enter his username, stock symbol, the company name and click add stock.
            - This adds the details entered into a database "stocks".
            - On the basis of username, the details of the stock are queried from the database(used in MyStocks and Comparison)
            - 'Back to dashboard' button directs the user back to the dashboard.


     -> Delete Stock:
            - User needs to enter his username and stock symbol that he wants to delete.
            - Upon clicking on Delete Stock, on the basis of the username, stock symbol, the stock is deleted from the database
              The same is reflected in MyStocks.

     -> Your Trade Guide:
            - Gives recommendation to users for selling or investing in stocks
            - There are 2 buttons - Invest, Sell
            - User needs to click on invest if he has plans on investing in any stock(neednot be the stocks that he has in MyStocks).
              A new window opens where the user needs to enter the symbol of the stock he plans to invest in and the company name.Upon
              enter, the following recommendations can be given:
                  -The stock has increased significantly, consider investing.
                  -The stock price is stable, making it a safer investment.
                  -The stock has had a significant peak, but be cautious.
                  -The stock is inconsistent, consider holding off on investment.
              These recommendations are given after analysing last one month of stock data. From the data, we extract the highest price, latest price, %change in price(previous day to present day) and the standard deviation(STD) of closing price over the month. The STD of the stock highlights the consistency of prices.
            - User needs to click on sell if he has plans on selling any of the shares he has.
              A new window opens where the user needs to enter the symbol, companyname and date on which he had bought the shares. Upon enter, the application suggests on whether to go ahead and sell the stock or not. It also suggests whether to sell at once or wait for some time to lock in more profits, depending upon the market performance.

        -> Compare Stocks:
            - Users can compare any two stocks from their "MyStocks" list. A dropdown menu allows them to select the symbols of the two stocks they wish to compare. They can also specify the time interval for the plot (from date to date) and choose the periodicity (daily, weekly, or monthly).
         
        -> Exit:
            - Directs the user back to the main page.
